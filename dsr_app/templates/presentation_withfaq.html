        <h3 align="left">What is Super Donor?</h3>
        <p align="left">Super Donor is a tool to predict whether distinct sperm donor bank and ID listings might actually
        represent the same underlying person. 25% of sperm donors report donating to more than one bank, and sperm banks
        sometimes transfer samples, resulting in multiple listings for the same underlying donor. Super Donor makes this
        information more accessible and useful for families and donor-conceived people seeking out information
        about their genetic connections.</p>

        <h3 align="left">How can I use Super Donor?</h3>
        <p align="left">To use this tool, enter the bank and donor ID for the donor you would like to search. This will produce a
        rank-ordered list of similar donors and prediction of whether these other donors are “Likely”, “Possibly”
        or “Unlikely” the same donor. </p>

        <h3 align="left">How should I interpret the predictions?</h3>
        <p align="left">No predictive tool is perfect, especially a tool like this that is looking for “needles in a haystack.”
        This tool is only a first step — it cannot ever say definitively whether two donor IDs are truly the
        same person. If the ranked list produces “Likely” or “Possible” matches for your donor, take a look at their
        features, look up their full descriptions on the <a href="http://donorsiblingregistry.com">Donor Sibling Registry</a> —
        do the longer descriptions seem very similar? If you are
        a person seeking genetic connections, you can consider reaching out to listings under this other donor
        ID via the DSR messaging system or other means, but remember that the only a genetic test can truly confirm a
        match.</p>

        <h3 align="left">My list doesn’t produces only “Unlikely” matches, but I know for sure there is an ID on this
        list that is the same person, what went wrong?</h3>
        <p align="left">This tool is structured to give a ranked list even when there are no predicted matches because the
        algorithm is only a first step. Especially if descriptions for donors are not very long, or if there is missing
        information (e.g. no blood type or eye color), the algorithm can produce an “Unlikely” rating for a true match.
        You can still seek out more information on the top-ranked donors to see if one of them might be a match.
        Also, keep in mind that most donors will NOT have a duplicate listing</p>

        <h3 align="left">Why isn't my donor listed?</h3>
        <p align="left">Super Donor includes donors from 32 banks listed on the
        <a href="http://donorsiblingregistry.com">Donor Sibling Registry</a>, focused on banks with larger
        numbers of donors and banks known to have transferred samples between banks. These data were pulled from the
        Donor Sibling Registry in June 2016, and only donors with sufficient descriptive
        information for a prediction to be made are included here.</p>

        <h3 align="left">I know of a confirmed match, can I get this information included in Super Donor?</h3>
        <p align="left">This project relied small training known matches, and works best for donors who are similar in some
        way to this original training set. The more true matches we know of, the stronger the predictive power of this
        tool will be. If you know of a confirmed match — distinct donor IDs that represent the same underlying person —
        please consider contacting me so I can add this information to the model. I can be reached at nathan.the.vc at gmail.</p>

        <h3 align="left">How does Super Donor work?</h3>
        <p align="left">Super Donor uses Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Metric-Learning to analyze
        what descriptive words and physical features are most important for determining whether two distinct donor
        listings represent the same underlying donor. There is more information available in the slides below.</p>

        <h3 align="left">Does this project compromise the privacy of donors or donor-offspring?</h3>
        <p align="left">This project works only from information already listed publicly on the DSR and does not seek to match
        donor features to an individual sperm donor. That is, Super Donor detects possible matches between anonymous
        donors, NOT links between an anonymous donor ID and the identity of the donor himself (which would be a much
        harder problem, and likely ill-advised from an ethical standpoint). Information about individual donor
        offspring that could be potentially identifying (e.g. login names or birth month/year) is not included.</p>

        <h3 align="left">Why did you build Super Donor?</h3>
        I love using Mathematics and Data Science to shine light where information is scarce, noisy and messy —
        but insight is deeply needed. Despite increasing rates of conception with donor sperm, there is no centralized
        source of information — there isn’t even an accurate count of how many donor conceived people are born in
        the US per year. Careful and creative analysis of crowd-sourced data like the DSR can help fill in the gaps
        and provide real information to people who need it. This project was also a great way to practice Natural
        Language Processing and Metric-Learning tools on an unwieldy real-world data set, some of my key goals as a
        participant in the <a href="http://insighthealthdata.com">Insight Health Data Science</a> Program in Boston,
        Summer 2016.
